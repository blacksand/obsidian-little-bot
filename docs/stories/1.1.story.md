# Story 1.1: Loading and Parsing Note-Based Command Templates

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a 用户
- I want 在一篇或多篇普通的 Obsidian 笔记中定义我的 "Little Bot" 指令
- so that 我可以使用我熟悉的笔记和 Dataview 语法来轻松地查看和管理我的自定义指令。

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. 插件启动时必须检查 Dataview 插件是否已安装并启用。如果未启用，应在插件设置中或通过通知(Notice)提醒用户，"Little Bot" 的指令功能需要 Dataview 插件。
2. 插件启动后，使用 Dataview API 查找所有包含特定属性（例如 type:: command-template）的笔记。
3. 插件必须能够解析这些笔记中的内容（例如，一个特定语言的代码块或 frontmatter区域）来抽取出意图和参数的定义。
4. 系统必须能够优雅地处理找到多篇命令模板笔记的情况，例如将所有定义合并在一起。
5. 如果某一篇命令模板笔记中存在语法错误，插件应跳过该笔记的加载，并在开发者控制台记录一条清晰、用户友好的错误信息，指出是哪一篇笔记出了问题。

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Check for Dataview plugin and notify user if not enabled.
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Use Dataview API to find notes with 'type:: command-template' property.
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Parse note content to extract intent and parameter definitions.
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Handle merging definitions from multiple command template notes.
- [ ] Task 5 (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Gracefully handle syntax errors in command template notes.

## Dev Notes

[[LLM: populates relevant information, only what was pulled from actual artifacts from docs folder, relevant to this story. Do not invent information. Critical: If known add Relevant Source Tree info that relates to this story. If there were important notes from previous story that are relevant to this one, also include them here if it will help the dev agent. You do NOT need to repeat anything from coding standards or test standards as the dev agent is already aware of those. The dev agent should NEVER need to read the PRD or architecture documents or child documents though to complete this self contained story, because your critical mission is to share the specific items needed here extremely concisely for the Dev Agent LLM to comprehend with the least about of context overhead token usage needed.]]

### Testing

[[LLM: Scrum Master use `test-strategy-and-standards.md` to leave instruction for developer agent in the following concise format, leave unchecked if no specific test requirement of that type]]
Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] {{type f.e. Jest}} Unit Tests: (nextToFile: {{true|false}}), coverage requirement: {{from strategy or default 80%}}
- [ ] {{type f.e. Jest with in memory db}} Integration Test (Test Location): location: {{Integration test location f.e. `/tests/story-name/foo.spec.cs` or `next to handler`}}
- [ ] {{type f.e. Cypress}} E2E: location: {{f.e. `/e2e/{epic-name/bar.test.ts`}}

Manual Test Steps: [[LLM: Include how if possible the user can manually test the functionality when story is Ready for Review, if any]]

{{ f.e. `- dev will create a script with task 3 above that you can run with "npm run test-initiate-launch-sequence" and validate Armageddon is initiated`}}

### Debug Log References

[[LLM: (SM Agent) When Drafting Story, leave next prompt in place for dev agent to remove and update]]
[[LLM: (Dev Agent) If the debug is logged to during the current story progress, create a table with the debug log and the specific task section in the debug log - do not repeat all the details in the story]]

### Completion Notes List

[[LLM: (SM Agent) When Drafting Story, leave next prompt in place for dev agent to remove and update - remove this line to the SM]]
[[LLM: (Dev Agent) Anything the SM needs to know that deviated from the story that might impact drafting the next story.]]

### File List

[[LLM: (Dev Agent) List every new file created, or existing file modified in a bullet list.]]

### Change Log
