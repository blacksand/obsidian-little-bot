# Little Bot for Obsidian

**Little Bot** is an Obsidian plugin that supercharges your workflow by allowing you to execute complex commands using natural language. It acts as an intelligent layer on top of Obsidian's powerful features, making automation accessible to everyone.

This project is a monorepo managed by **Nx** and **pnpm**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Natural Language Commands**: Simply type what you want to do, and Little Bot will handle the rest.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Define your own commands and workflows using simple templates in your Obsidian notes.
- **Seamless Integration**: Designed to work with your existing Obsidian setup and other plugins like Dataview.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blacksand/obsidian-little-bot.git
   cd obsidian-little-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

### Development

To build the plugin for development and watch for changes, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will create a `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` in the `dist/apps/little-bot` directory. You can then manually copy this directory into your Obsidian vault's `.plugins` directory to test the plugin.
